Project on Fibonnaci Series

# Description
What is Fibonacci Series? Apart from a fun name?
It is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Sounds fun right? Let's see the basic working-
For e.g. The series is- 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3 and so on. Go ahead try out your addition skills!

Well fibonacci series just doesn't interest the mathematicians; it is also used in pop culture!! Did you know?
- The Criminal Minds episode "Masterpiece" in season 4 features a serial killer who uses Fibonacci sequences to choose both the number of victims he kills at a given time, as well as the location of their hometowns.
- In the Disney Channel TV show So Weird, the Fibonacci sequence is used to build a house. The house becomes a nexus for lost spirits. One character, Fiona, is given a choice to use it to free her father as well as the builder of the house, but ultimately chooses to free the spirits, and destroys the nexus.
- Black Star’s Mos Def & Talib Kweli are Black Star incorporated the Fibonacci sequence in their song:
Now everybody hop on the one, the sounds of the two
It’s the third eye vision, five side dimension
The 8th Light, is gonna shine bright tonight

ISN'T THIS AWESOME!!!!!!

Fibonacci Series also appears in the pascal's triangle as shown below-
